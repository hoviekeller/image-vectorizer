It accepts a wide variety of images including ".png", ".jpg", ".bmp", and many more. Simply drag & drop an image in the add-on (top left corner of the UI) and then click on the action button. The vectorized image will be rendered at the result box (top right corner).

You can also choose your desired serializing method from the drop-down list within the UI. The pre-set method is - default. There are 15 other methods to choose from the list. There is also a -live preview - button to make the vectorizing process on the fly. As you change any method, the result will be rendered in the top right section without pressing the action button.
